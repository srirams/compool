# Compool interface for HomeAssistant

Control your Compool pool automation system from HomeAssistant

## Info

You will need a RS-485 adapter. A RS-485 - USB adapter is ~$6 on Amazon.

See https://carlstrom.com/pool/compool/ for the cable needed.

## Not implemented

* Full LX3830 support
* Solar support
* Pool temperature (only spa temp)

* I've mostly added what I needed, if there's interest in anything else it shouldn't be too hard to add.
